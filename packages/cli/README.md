# The Core DomeniereJS CLI
This package is the CLI for [DomeniereJS](https://www.domeniere.com/).

# DomeniereJS
DomeniereJS is a Typescript library for creating Framework-Independent applications. You can think of a Domeniere application like a shell or enclosure for your application logic, which leaves out the infrastructure implementation details. This allows you to quickly adopt your application to many different frameworks as your needs change. With DomeniereJS, you encapsulate the concrete aspects of your application into a modular library you can use anywhere, and pass in any framework specific details as dependencies to adopt its behavior to its environment.
